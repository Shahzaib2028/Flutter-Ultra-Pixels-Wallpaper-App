## Flutter-Ultra-Pixels-Wallpaper-App

This is my very first project on flutter and this one is version 1.0.0. I know it needs a alot of changes as learning will never ever ends and I also try to improve my skills
so please dont judge me only this single project as it is my first flutter project. THANK YOU


### INTRODUCTION

This is a wallpaper app from where you can download any type of wallpaper or images by searching. I am using the UNSPLASH API for getting the images . you can request API KEY from https://unsplash.com/documentation. 

### SCREENSHOTS

The first page is the home page where you get some by default categories, by clicking on this categories you can get the respective images.

<img src="ultra_pixels/images/home.png" width = 300 height = 600>

You can also search any category as you can see in below screenshort I search for apples.

<img src="ultra_pixels/images/search.png" width = 300 height = 600>

Then you can click on the image you like and you get a popup for download, so by click on yes the image is downloaded.

<img src="ultra_pixels/images/download.png" width = 300 height = 600>

Your image is downloaded in the the following path of your mobile phone. Go to file manager then

Android/data/com.example.ultra_pixels/files/https/images.unsplash.com/

At this path you found your downloaded image.


### GENERATE APK

To generate APK file first clone the repository and open terminal and navigate to the ultra pixel folder and write the following command:

flutter build apk

By run this command you have new folder named build in ulter pixel project. navigate to
build/app/outputs/apk/release/

here you have apk file 

install this apk on your android phone and enjoy!!!
